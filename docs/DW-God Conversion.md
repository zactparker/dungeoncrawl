## Frames!

Welcome to the **Firmament**! A world of warring stories and shifting starlight. This is a world where terrestrial denizens live, love, and die beneath a teeming sky of shining, multicolored stars. These stars are interchangeably referred to as **Frames**, **Celestials**, or **Celestial Frames**. The Frames appear as neon outlines of characteristically identifiable shapes in an array of warm and cool hues. Frames travel, attend to their business, speak with one another, and engage in all the activities we might ascribe to willful, sentient beings. The meeting and lingering of frames overhead is an event in and of itself, called **Arguments**, or sometimes **Divine Arguments**. It is usually thought that the three Frames most prominent in the sky above on the night of a person's birth determine important facets of their character, personality, and fate. The **lively sky** above usually prevents all but the most well-trained from divining specific meaning from the stars, though scholars called **Wanderers** strive desperately to learn and map their positions.
## Homebrew Gods in Pathfinder

In Pathfinder, Gods have edicts and anathema -- things they exhort their followers to do and things they abhor.  Clerics in the Firmament typically follow one or more signs of their birth and find themselves bound to the dictates of those signs. Others typically give some amount of praise to one or more of their personal frames, worshipping some combination (7500+ possible!) of the 21 Frames presented below. Non-cleric player characters are not bound by the edicts and anathema of their personal frames, but may find their lives impacted by the extent to which they embody these lofty ideals.

To give them a characteristic flair, each god has a signature weapon, skill, and stat, plus a portfolio of concepts within their domain and some special spells for their clerics.
## Gods of the Starlight Isles

Playing host to agents of the Frames above has predisposed the Syreni toward practices of idolatry and saint worship. Expect particular frames to be described in terms of living or dead quasi-mythic figures just as much as the more abstract Frames themselves. You can always make up a saint, if you feel like it.

In an incident almost 100 years old by the start of our story, three Frames fell from the sky, ushering in an age of terror and confusion called the Starfall as all memory of those Frames and the mortal edifices built upon them vanished from the world. Characters younger than 100 years old are not born under the frames now known to be the Firstfallen, Secondfallen, and Thirdfallen. 

Though exceedingly rare in most parts of the world, the cosmopolitan character of the Starlight Isles has drawn strange folk who eschew worship of the **Heavenly Drama** of the frames and the stars under which they were born to instead worship another entity, listed at the end of this note. Such persons are often regarded with inherent suspicion, and might find it hard to proselytize amidst star-worshippers.
