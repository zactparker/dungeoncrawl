Below are the titles granted to nobility in Scythrân. The only court in the land to use all of these titles at all times is the Court of the Blessed Monarch, typically housed in the capital city of Titan. Lesser courts of the 19 Seneschalties may use any configuration of these roles as required to suit their needs. Noble titles change hands through Divinity, Death, or Duels.

  

Enshrined with the crowning of the first Blessed Monarch Théomann Emerick I, the title of Blessed Monarch is held by the person Divinely Ordained by magic itself to steward the Partition. Custom dictates that, upon assuming the throne, the Ordained forgoes their given name and chooses a holy name, typically the name of Théomann Emerick or a member of his Great House. The only Blessed Monarchs to forgo this tradition are Loïc I, who reigned immediately following Théomann I for one unpleasant week, and the reigning queen Osanna Vair-Bore.

  

All other positions are typically passed to a hand-picked successeur upon Death or debility of the current holder of office. Since the failed rebellion of the Duc Odouart des Paulmes, children of the Blessed Monarch are typically prepared from birth to set their ambitions as high as assuming a role through succession in order to ensure their family an enduring place at court.

  

Succession by Duel was popularized by the Great and Honorable Milusène Emerick I. The tradition was ensconced firmly in the ways of the land by his daughter Milusène II, and her niece Milusène III after her, during an astonishing 70-year span where a single bloodline held the Blessed Throne. In its original conception, any person who could reach the bearer of an office was entitled to challenge that official to a duel to the death or the wound, with the petitioner selecting the location and the official selecting the weapon. Though still practiced to this day and orchestrated with fervor by the Honorable House of Puis (descendants of the Monarch Milusène I), many of the less martially inclined at court breathed a hearty sigh of relief when Théomann II reformed the practice to make victory at an annual contest held at the Winter Palace a prerequisite for issuing a challenge.
