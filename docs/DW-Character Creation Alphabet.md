## Preamble 1: Pathbuilder

This guide references a handy tool called [Pathbuilder](http://pathbuilder2e.com). While there is some value in sorting every piece of your character sheet out by hand, I strongly recommend Pathbuilder because it aggregates every relevant rule and option for you to pick from as you build your character, and lets you save a persistent build plan for your character from 1-20. When you're happy with your build for a level, you can play either with your pathbuilder up on a laptop for reference or try using a printed character sheet. Most people just bring a computer and keep pathbuilder up. 

## Preamble 2: Rarity and Level

Every feature in Pathfinder, from Ancestries to Items, has a **rarity** of Common, Uncommon, or Rare. Outside of Ancestries, Backgrounds, and Classes, each feature also has a Level. Rarity is how features are sorted in pathbuilder, and is also visible near the top alongside the other tags in each Archives of Nethys entry. Level is a rough approximation of how much force a given thing can exert on the world.

Level is how items scale internally (ex. Major healing potions are Level 18, Minor ones are Level 1, so you can expect a higher level healing potion to be more powerful) and externally (loot is awarded across the party from a budget for each character level, the budget maps onto values derived from item levels). You can't pick a feat or create an item higher than your character's level, and you should expect to have a hard time getting access to items and equipment more than 1 level higher than your character.

You're a fantasy character. You are by definition rare. **Rarity tags should be viewed as ways to dial in how much you want something to matter for your character.** A character with a rare Ancestry, like being a mechanical [Poppet](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=49) or just straight up a [Skeleton](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=50), is probably going to have to deal with that a lot more than a more common creature like a Goblin or an Elf.

## Preamble 3: Math

Numbers in Pathfinder get fairly large, because characters add their level to most things they're good at. And, since there's not a relatively easy to farm bonus mechanic like Advantage, each point matters.

What this means is that when picking the numerical components of your character you should put an 18 (four boosts) in the stat that your class gives you a boost in. Similarly, you should make sure you're Trained in the core skills that will help you realize your character fantasy. 
## A for Ancestry:

Quick note to start--I've been very pleasantly surprised with the Ancestry descriptions in this game. Each Ancestry has something to them that feels really unique and fun but also not desperately offensive. I actually enjoyed reading the entries of even the bog-standard fantasy races. Gnomes are cool now! Check out the Nethys entry and rules for your Ancestry before you commit to one. That's a big ask since there's a million of them, so if you're pressed for time just look for the part in every entry that begins with "If you want to play a character that..." to get a sense of that Ancestry.

Characters of all ancestries are present in the Partition. The dominant peoples of this region are Dwarves, Halflings, Humans, and Orcs. Animal-kin folk are less common, but [Grippli](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=46), [Kobolds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=18), [Lizardfolk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=15), and [Vanara](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=55) all occupy positions of higher status across the Partition, owing to their ancient ancestors' continued presence and influence on the region. In this part of the world, people with Animal-kin Ancestries are presumed to be related through distant blood ties to one of the Ancient Beasts.


Almost immediately after the Partition was established, the various magical creatures now trapped in a land sealed from magic made their displeasure known. From about 1060 OW ~ 748 OW was a time known as the Age of Beasts, where magical creatures established fiefdoms and claimed dominion over the land. Proving nigh-impossible to kill on account of being magical creatures with all their magic sealed inside of them, these creatures swept through embattled, isolated peoples with little resistance and ruled for uninterrupted centuries.

  

Seeking to hide their less-than-mythic origins, the most sinister of the Beastlords thus attempted to systematically suppress and murder particularly wide-ranging and long-lived folk. Most Elves and Gnomes alive today have some level of family history reckoning with this violence, be that having cultivated ancestral techniques to fight monsters, having hidden themselves away, or having bought survival through entering into a protection arrangement with a Beastlord. Despite being similarly long-lived, most Dwarves' insular tendencies shielded them from the worst of these monstrous acts.
#### Subpoint: Heritages:

Heritages specific to your chosen Ancestry will all have the Common trait, while Uncommon and Rare heritages can be attached to any Ancestry. I think the common heritages tend to be a little more fun since they engage directly with things that can help you flesh out your character's appearance, vibe, etc.
## B for Background:

All common Backgrounds with the General trait should fit well with this campaign. Backgrounds tied to a specific region in Pathfinder/Golarion lore (flagged as regional in Pathbuilder) are viable, but you'll just need to give me a heads up that you're using them and will need an analogous region for your character.

Backgrounds in Pathfinder provide some pretty serious benefits, typically including ability score boosts and a skill feat. Skill feats provide unique ways to use your character's skills in Downtime, Exploration, and Combat. I've found the most enjoyment out of picking backgrounds either on the basis of finding the name charming or by starting from a skill feat I think is neat and going backwards from there.

## C for Class:

All 22 Pathfinder 2nd Edition classes are available for play in this campaign.

Uncommon classes (at time of writing Gunslinger and Inventor) are restricted to hailing from Charmânn, the Blasted Spellwastes. Charmânn borders Sycthrân to the west, and holding the Charmânn Admirality back from invading its resource-rich and technologically underdeveloped neighbor is generally understood to be the signature accomplishment of the Oracle Queen Osanna Vair-Bore. Charmâ and those who bear their strange weaponry are often met with suspicion and mistrust by the people of the Partition.
### Subpoint: Class Archetypes

Class Archetypes are odd class-agnostic feature adjustments for spellcasters, available at level 1. If you want to change how spellcasting works at a pretty fundamental level for your class, doing things like giving yourself an elemental spell list or more slots with a risk of failure, you can take an archetype. For example, if I wanted to play a prepared spellcaster but didn't want to deal with Vancian spellcasting (where you prepare spells to slots rather than as a pool), I could take the Flexible Spell Preparation archetype which gives me fewer spells per day but I prepare them as a group rather than into specific slots.
### Subpoint: Multiclassing and Dedication Feats

Whenever you gain a class feat at an even level, you can also choose a Dedication Feat. Dedication Feats are how you multiclass in Pathfinder 2nd Edition. If you take one Dedication Feat you must then take at least 2 subsequent Feats for that Dedication before you can take a different Dedication Feat.

Keep in mind that this will slow down your main class progression because you'll have fewer class feats, but it can be worth it to specialize around areas of interest like a particular weapon, broadening your focus pool uses, or picking up extra spellcasting.
## D for Deity:
(In pathbuilder: Details tab -> fill in Deity with 3 Frames)

Every Pathfinder character is associated with a Deity. The Gods are straight-up real, so most people aren't atheists. For in-depth information, see [[God Conversion]] for more on Deities in this setting. For a shorter list, see [[Gods Table]]. Your character's life and stars sit at the confluence of three Deities, which are called Frames. When it comes up in game we'll take a second to pick Frames if you haven't yet.
## Aside: E1 for Edicts

Pathfinder doesn't use an alignment system. You're welcome to give an alignment to your character, but may find it more productive to use the alternative option: Edicts and Anathema. Just like deities, player characters have strong beliefs or rules they tend to follow, and certain things they would never do.

Write one edict and one anathema for your character to see if this works for you. Your character's personal Edicts and Anathema should be related to those of at least one of your Frames, which you could treat as the most significant Frame in your character's experience.

## E2 for Equipment:
(In pathbuilder: Weapons tab -> add weapon; Armor tab -> change; Gear tab -> add gear)

Rather than starting with class equipment, Pathfinder characters start with a pool of 15 gold that they put towards gear. This is a great way to get fun little items like thieves' tools, crowbars, ladders, or other mundane objects that _ALL HAVE RULES AND BENEFITS IN PATHFINDER (omg!)._

If you don't want to deal with this, type "myclassname kit pf2e" into google and add the items on the ensuing Archives of Nethys page to your character sheet, subtracting the gold cost from your total.
### Subpoint: Gold

Pathfinder's balancing presumes that characters are pretty much constantly acquiring items and loot as they adventure, but the scale is much tighter than other systems. Basic healing potions cost 4gp, then scale up to 12g Lesser potions at Level 3, 50g Moderate potions at Level 6, and so on. You'll always have

## F for Feats:

Feats are the bread and butter of character customization. As you read your class, you'll find that classes give a huge number of level 1 features, which then evolve slowly as the character grows. Most of the ways players are expected to grow and customize their characters are by using feats.  

Feats fall into the categories of General, Skill, Class, and Ancestry, allowing you to grow and develop all four of these areas of your character as they level up. Most feats unlock other feats, and the system rewards specialization quite a bit more than it does jack-of-all-trades, so I encourage you to think about your feats as ways to open up repeatable, interesting options for things you'd like your character to be able to do.


To be clear, **there are too many feats to really read through**. Fortunately, Pathfinder has built-in mechanics to let players Retrain their choices! Smaller things, like swapping a skill feat for a different skill feat, take about a week. Bigger things, like shifting a subclass, take a minimum of a month and usually require some pretty serious RP. These might seem like really crazy time requirements coming from 5e, but what this really means is that in built-in downtime between adventures your character can revise their abilities to whatever extent you enjoy!
