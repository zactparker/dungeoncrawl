*Starfall Sagas: Dead and Wet* is a dungeon crawl campaign that starts at the bottom of Lac Souhaitant near the bustling mortal refuge of Urles in the Blessed Battlefields of Scythrân, a corner of the Nameless Expanse in the world of The Firmament. Your character will delve beneath water and worry to grasp the secret workings of an ecosystem of death and wishes grown in a strange ruin called the Mantle Yielding. You'll begin as 9th-level characters who are one of four aspiring Saints of the Firstfallen, longtime friends whose ill-starred lives converge at the watery precipice of an ancient temple dedicated to a dead, obliviated God. 

### The Refuge Beyond Beasts, Urles
Known for its warrenlike streets and dense architecture, the city of Urles is one of the few bastions of the Blessed Throne in Scythrân's southeastern wetlands. Built atop a natural stronghold with rising hills on three sides and a steep drop to a charming lake, Urles had stood since the days before the reign of the first Blessed Monarch, Théomann Emerick I. The Oracle Queen's journey never brought her to the City of Refuge, but faith and fervor in the Blessed Throne remains a triumphant characteristic of the region. 

Urles is one of few cities in Scythrân to maintain its own standing militia, the Amber Archons, many of whose youngest conscripts complete their training and move on to join the Knightly Orders of the Blessed Throne. Compulsory military service with few enemies to fight breeds mixtures of ingenuity and dissent. Urles' feats of civic engineering are second across Scythrân only to Titan's Serpentscapes, but gangs of well-trained malcontents stalk the streets and sewers of the Refuge, waiting to prey upon unwary travelers. 

### The Mantle Yielding
Fetid scents rise from the Wishing Lake, the once-shining waters that inspired defiance and granted refuge from great beasts now grow murky and stagnant. Pathetic, waterlogged things wash up to shore and trudge towards the lights and life of Urles. Initial explorations have uncovered a bizarre, immense stone structure beneath the Souhaitant, its presence announced by bloated death and sullied waters. For you, it feels like home. Something in the waves calls to you. It visits you in daydreams. It sings and you must reply. It calls you to death and wet, and you have answered. 

## Character Suggestions

### Ancestries
Any Ancestry or Heritage with a swim speed and the ability to breathe underwater will have a strong advantage in delving the Mantle. Dwarves, Halflings, Humans, and Orcs are common in this region, as are the cave-dwelling amphibious Azarketi. Beastkin like Grippli, Kobolds, Lizardfolk, and Vanara are less common in the Urles Refuge, and are often presumed to be fitful emissaries of their elder lords rather than free agents. Elves and Gnomes of the Chausseurs are scarce in Urles, owing to the city's founding as a free state for short-lived folk and its distance from the Five Holds. It is unlikely that your character is both a long-lived folk and a onetime worshipper of the Firstfallen. Without regard to setting, Ancestries who rely on negative healing may find themselves immune to a number of their undead opponents' usual tricks, but might complicate things substantially for their party members. Conversely, Ancestries and Heritages with bonuses against death, disease, drain, fear, paralysis, poison, and void damage will excel in this adventure.
### Classes
Dead and Wet foes are best met with Live and Mobile heroes. Barbarians, Champions, Clerics, Exemplars, Oracles, and Rangers are particularly well-suited to delving the Mantle Yielding. And, worshippers of the Firstfallen practiced a variety of arts. Classes who excel in detecting traps and manipulating battlefields will find their skills put to use in this dungeon crawl. No class is a guaranteed poor choice, but classes who best succeed by inflicting disease, paralysis, poison, precision damage, or unconsciousness on their opponents will struggle against the risen dead. Classes who rely on firearms, such as Gunslingers and some Inventors, will have an extremely hard time using their abilities underwater.
### Languages
The primary language used in Scythrân is Common, specifically a strain of Common derived from Giant. Any other common languages are helpful to know. As seasoned adventurers, having a shared unusual language may allow you to covertly communicate tactics or plots. Aquan and Necril are particularly strong language choices against a Temple chock full of things both Wet and Dead.
### Faiths
You are an adherent of the Firstfallen. You do not know its name or likeness, but may have surmised information about it through observing ritual objects like wells of ink and segmented flails tipped with beaklike spikes. Similarly, you may engage in practices specific to your faith to which you have assigned your own meaning, such as skin-staining, self-enclosure or binding of movement, drowning of foes, glassblowing, or ornate embraces.
### Skills and Feats
Nature and Religion will help you to navigate a complex underwater ecosystem built upon the ruins of a dead faith. Athletics is the skill rolled to swim, and should be considered vital even for characters who find ways to gain a swim speed. 

### Starfallen 
If your character is older than 40 years old, they are Starfallen, having lost the Frame known as the Firstfallen. Such a character could be Twicefallen or Thricefallen for maximum angst, but they must have been born under a now-dead star. If your character is younger than 40 years old, they are not Starfallen. All of you were born, created, and/or raised in old Duncére in the two-decade span following the Starfall. You know basic information about this small port town, specifically the wharf district, and may have strong feelings about its second life post-Partition as a rising trade hub.
### Oblivion
Communities who organized themselves around veneration of a Frame that perished in the Starfall descended into chaos with the death of their Gods. Take time to think about how that absence affected your character's life and worldview. Names inflected with holy meaning lost their sound and song. Forgetting like a metal taste in the back of your throat. A song you will never recall the words to. The caress that once soothed your unruly mind, now dry and wrong. Most devout who did survive this troubled time did so through invention. Your character may have been forced to fabricate new stories to support things that once were second nature to them, then forced to defend those justifications with your life as splintering faiths and shattered minds tore your home apart. 
### Partition
As our beloved Sleepwalkers have discovered, Scythrân was severed from magic for over a millennia to contain the otherworldly threat posed by the Colèba of Thála Óneiron. Your characters may remember a world before magic, where ordinary folk teetered between the whims of great Beastlords and the attentions of a cosmically ordained Blessed Monarch. For characters whose power comes from a divine source, the co-occurrence of your new magic and your community's forced apostasy may have inspired peculiar notions about your role in your faith and the world.

### Aside 1: Difficulty 
This is going to be an old-school-ish dungeon crawl. You might have a hard time securing a safe place to rest overnight. Monsters will know their surroundings and habitats better than you do. Some foes may have unusual defenses and uncanny means of avoiding peril, requiring you to investigate their lairs before mounting an attack. 
### Aside 2: Aquatic Combat
We're going to be dealing with a fairly even mix of aquatic and terrestrial combat. Please familiarize yourself with the rules of Aquatic Combat, reproduced below, as they may substantially affect your character choices. 
- You're off-guard unless you have a swim Speed.  
- You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.  
- You take a –2 circumstance penalty to melee slashing or bludgeoning attacks that pass through water.  
- Ranged attacks that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage automatically miss if the attacker or target is underwater, and piercing ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.  
- You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater. As normal for how traits work, any part of the effect that's unrelated to fire still works. For example, an attack with a flaming battleaxe could still deal its physical damage, just not its fire damage.  
- At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.  

You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn. You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including Casting a Spell) you lose all remaining air.  
  
When you run out of air, you fall unconscious and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take 1d10 damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).
