Welcome to the **Firmament**! The gods of this world are interchangeably referred to as **Frames**, **Celestials**, or **Celestial Frames**. The Frames appear as neon outlines of characteristically identifiable shapes in an array of warm and cool hues. It is usually thought that the three Frames most prominent in the sky above on the night of a person's birth determine important facets of their character, personality, and fate. The **lively sky** above usually prevents all but the most well-trained from divining specific meaning from the stars, though scholars called **Wanderers** strive desperately to learn and map their positions.
## Gods of the Partition, Scythr√¢n

In an incident over 40 years old by the start of our story, three Frames fell from the sky, ushering in an age of terror and confusion called the Starfall as all memory of those Frames and the mortal edifices built upon them vanished from the world. Characters younger than 40 years old are not born under the frames now known to be the Firstfallen, Secondfallen, and Thirdfallen. 

## Pick 3 Frames:
Use this table to make quick choices about your character's signs and stars. You can find more information about each Frame in [[God Conversion]]. Alignment used here for sake of convenience, even though Pathfinder as a system has moved away from alignment. Optionally, pick 1 Entity instead of selecting Frames.
