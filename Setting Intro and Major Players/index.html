<h3 id="vibe">Vibe<a class="headerlink" href="#vibe" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You're in sword-and-sorcery France! Population just shy of 20 million, spanning the south-southwestern region of the Nameless Expanse. The mountainous regions of the eastern and north reaches of the Scythrân reach vertical elevations similar to the real-world Alps, while the south of the continent is a long stretch of alternately rocky and sandy coastline with a more Mediterranean clime.</p>
<p>Magic wasn't a thing here outside of the workings of the Blessed Throne for over a millennia. Now 38 years since the starfall, people generally have a bias towards the martial, or may still associate magic with cruel and indifferent patrons despite its much more common current provenance.</p>
<p>On account of the dangers of their homeland, Scythrâ are accustomed to a life that is short. They exist at the whims of various higher powers, with even the most developed of regions historically dependent on the benevolence of a Throne that does not always keep its obligations. As their best, people of Scythrân are predisposed to festival and fun to make the best of their lot. At their worst, their revelries come off as callous, dismissive responses to a world beyond their control.</p>
<p>Prominent Regional Frames in Scythrân:</p>
<p>Apple, Bull, Butterflies, Dragon, Guard, Ogre, Scythe, Spiral</p>
<h1 id="scythran-the-partition-local-forces">Scythrân, the Partition--Local Forces<a class="headerlink" href="#scythran-the-partition-local-forces" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<h2 id="blessed-throne">Blessed Throne<a class="headerlink" href="#blessed-throne" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When the Partition rose it was meant to have champions. Stewards who saw the wisdom in seclusion and would safeguard this strange garden's inhabitants with an exclusive privilege: the Stewards were the only ones who could wield magic of any form within the golden limit. To prevent these people from seizing undisputed dynastic control over Scythrân, the right to Ordain each subsequent ruler was reserved not to blood, but to the magic itself.</p>
<p>Naturally, the stewards were the first killed in the Apo Rebellion, as various former magical practitioners now trapped inside a great prison attempted to seize power. This period of unrest was shortly followed by more and worse unrest. The Apo mages were few in number, and had little reason to cooperate with one another when relations of scholarly exchange were recast as the ties and decorum of Court. They were summarily destroyed when the Beastlords made their presence known and choose to exert their influence on the land.</p>
<p>Creatures of claw, scale, and tooth ruled Scythrân from 1,060 ~ 786 OW,  until the rainbow serpent Milusène united the short-lived peoples of the Partition with secret and deadly clans of Elven and Gnome Chasseurs to fight the Beastlords to a draw and install The Blessed King Théomann Emerick I. Thus began the Dominion of the Blessed Throne, and its five Orders of Knights reigned strong across Monarchs of various and sundry temperaments and dispositions. Having survived its most direct challenge yet in the ascension of the Oracle Queen Osanna Vair-Bore, machinations now turn amongst the Lords and Ladies at Court.</p>
<p>The Knights Order of the Blessed Throne are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order of Good Carriage, who travel and teach the people to midwife the land.</li>
<li>Order of the Grand Chariot, who serve as guides, pathfinders, and protectors.</li>
<li>Order of the Grub, who have no members at all but always a seat preserved for them.</li>
<li>Order of the Grass Cricket, whose husbanded great insects afford them an uncanny swiftness that has won many the days.</li>
<li>Order of the Golden Court, who mind the Capital City of Titan and shine with fervor and faith.  </li>
</ul>
<p>A character associated with the Blessed Throne might be a dispossessed scion of a bloodline thrown out of favor by the process of Ordainment, a deft participant at court accomplishing some goal in their travels, a knight or knight errant of one of the Five Orders, or may hail from the original families of Stewards thought destroyed in the Apo Rebellion. Such people may value family and tradition, see themselves as part of a great and noble whole, or seek to understand the favors and disfavors of capricious, ancient magics.  </p>
<h2 id="great-beasts">Great Beasts<a class="headerlink" href="#great-beasts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As the Partition rose, the great magical beings of the land found themselves changed. Unable to use the extraordinary and supernatural abilities that marked them as unique among their fellows, they instead found their bodies strengthened, lifespans functionally indefinite, and their ambitions broadened.  </p>
<p>Of the ranks of the myriad magical creatures trapped inside the Partition, nine Beastlords emerged to take a particular interest in the affairs of mortals. These creatures ruled the lands in the age before the achievements of Titan and the Blessed Throne. Now cowed from dreams of total domination, the Beastlords remain in fiefdoms exerting what influences they may on the world. This is true save for those beaten into death or submission by the Oracle Queen Osanna Vair-Bore.</p>
<p>The Beastlords are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucieque the Spider (dead)  </li>
<li>Cécillon the Boar (maimed)  </li>
<li>Alttal the Thrush  </li>
<li>Limellee the Wolf (missing)  </li>
<li>Purault the Monkey  </li>
<li>Ormier the Serpent  </li>
<li>Milusène the Couatl (beloved)  </li>
<li>Mauris the Dragon. </li>
<li>Asdon the Toad. </li>
</ul>
<p>A character associated with the Great Beasts might be a distant kin of the Beastlord, a lone wanderer searching out allies to help them overthrow an undying despot, or a secretive agent acting on behalf of regent and kin. Such people may have adopted the detached perspective and values of their patron, have close ties to a secluded community, or carry themselves with a strange, refined, and beastial bearing.  </p>
<h2 id="coleba-the-horrors-below">Colèba, the Horrors Below<a class="headerlink" href="#coleba-the-horrors-below" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Ooh, they got too many wiggly parts.  </p>
<p>Little is known about the aberrations whose very existence so frightened the Godmages of the Empire that they severed an entire region from the world and its magic. For most denizens of the Partition, the Horrors Below were boogeymen. Things that went bump in the night and lurked the world below. In the wake of the Starfall, these beings have made their presence much more keenly felt. For those in the northern reaches of the Country, the Colèba are monsters kept at bay and cleverly directed towards defending the land they once sought to corrupt by the great workings of the Oracle Queen. For those in the south and west, where burning corpse pyres are a sign of safe travel, these horrors are all too present and real.  </p>
<p>A character associated with the Colèba may be a sapient infiltrator into the world of mortals, a deluded pawn of unimaginable terrors, or a wily manipulator playing horrific forces off one another until the game runs out. Such people may be unstable, gifted with penetrating insights, or a ticking time bomb.   </p>
<h2 id="oracle-queen-osanna-vair-bore">Oracle Queen Osanna Vair-Bore<a class="headerlink" href="#oracle-queen-osanna-vair-bore" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Osanna Vair-Bore was thought to be a simple and docile girl from a young age, barely aware of her surroundings after witnessing her parents' cruel death in the Blessed Throne's suppression of the ill-starred Boso Uprising. This thought was wrong. Having spent the first quarter century of her life taming the roiling chaos of her mind's strange attunement to the Coléba, the Horrors Below, Osanna began a journey from her home on the Tortue to reach the gleaming steps of Titan.  </p>
<p>Vair-Bore's uncanny presence inspired awe in many and fear in others, exposing the cracks and fissures of each place she visited in her travels. Stories abound of her Sister and most loyal Knight trailing in her footsteps--and a growing army of devoted followers after them--meting out justice to the wicked forces that came to light as they pursued the Oracle.   </p>
<p>Vair-Bore's arrival to Titan nearly incited another war of succession between the children of the ailing queen Océane Emerick II, but her deft work united the Dauphin Hugh Emerick and his siblings Milisant, Aleida, Ysmene, and Seluue behind a single banner. This intervention was met with great umbrage by the Beastlords, who swiftly quieted their opposition when Vair-Bore slew Lucieque the Great Spider and drove Cécillon the Boar to its knees, permanently. Vair-Bore then vanished for a time, reappearing later with strange devices and magic pillars that she bade her new alliance set to work across the land. Having used these devices to secure the Coléba's apparent tacit cooperation, Vair-Bore's united front deterred a mounting invasion from the western Charmânn Admirality, brokering peace over sharp knives.  </p>
<p>A character associated with the Oracle Queen Osanna Vair-Bore may be a fanatical devotee, a proud patriot, or an agent of the Oracle Queen. Such people hold marks of her Holy Tusks and attempt to keep the Queen's peace and prosperity however they are able.  </p>
<h2 id="the-tortue">The Tortue<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tortue" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When the Partition rose and the outside world was expelled from the lands, a single creature of immense fortitude and power misliked the notion of being moved. A dragon turtle of immense size bit deep into the southern coast and held fast as the Sea of Lords around it swept back into void. It remained there, hanging, until it died on the doorstep of immortality! Raw deal!  </p>
<p>Some semblance of civilization on or around the Tortue was unthinkable until the dishonor and expulsion of Duc Odouart des Paulmes. Duc Odo was sent as far from Titan's gleaming streets as possible, put to work building an elaborate fortress atop a spire of rock jutting near the great dead tortoise. As exiled second sons are wont to do, Odo naturally staged a rebellion from his new floating castle, only to be cast from its precarious reaches, slide screaming down the metallic shell of the beast, and fall into the surrounding emptiness!  </p>
<p>Fittingly, Duc Odo's Salt Palace became an epicenter of future punishments. In harsher days, prisoners would stay a final night behind its walls before walking across harsh bones to the very edge of the world to be set loose with a push. Prisoners would carve <em>menhir</em> or standing stones to confess their crimes, then be cast off from the Tortue.  </p>
<p>The region enjoyed a minor, more cosmopolitan surge of popularity as seas returned and people built homes on the back of the now-floating Tortue to become Scythrân's first sea traders and salvagers in millennia, including the Oracle Queen's own family. In the decade since her journey, however, the Salt Palace now lies abandoned, and most sea trade now passes through the new ports of Caenbonne and Duncér.  </p>
<p>As the Oracle Queen departed her home, its macabre legacy came home to roost. One day, all the people of the Tortue received a vision firmly instructing them to abandon their lives and homes on the great creature's back. Then, a day later, the great skeleton detached itself from the coast, capsized, and righted itself with a strange bony form now perched upon its ancient brow! Some say that the Oracle Queen has made privateers of the Captain who calls himself Odo des Paulmes and his Vengeful Dead Pirates, while others insist that chartering a boat to the strange dead paradise is a <em>must</em> for any aspiring pilgrim.  </p>
<p>A character associated with the Tortue's present incarnation is a skeleton, bound by magic or oath to serve Captain Odo. Such people are mysterious and materialistic, eager to play on the mystique of the walking dead; or, they could be desperately troubled by the ends to which their unlife has been directed.  </p>
<h2 id="waxen-palm-guild">Waxen Palm Guild<a class="headerlink" href="#waxen-palm-guild" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Once the most prominent organized trading company across the Scythrân, the Waxen Palm Guild has fallen desperately out of favor. Anyone could tell you that Queen Osanna's strict prohibitions against war profiteering have made things harder for the embattled Guild, though most people know that's not quite the whole story. The Waxen Palm was previously known as the chief source of Emerite, a golden-grid veined stone that took Titan high society by storm due to its allegedly occult and mystical properties. Disputes over the origins of the obsequiously named rock (the Blessed Monarch has historically always taken the surname Emerick) have cast some doubt on the fad in more recent years. As Queen Osanna once asked in the highest halls of the Blessed Throne: _Where did you get this strange stone?  _</p>
<p>A character associated with the Waxen Palm Guild is on the tail end of about a decade of losing a covert/overt confrontation with the Oracle Queen and her most loyal. Such people traffick in strange objects and esoterica, dark bargains, and dreams of prosperity.  </p>

<p>The below entries are, as I currently view them, more regional or distant presences in this story that help shade in this world. But, stories change! If something about one or more of these smaller presences interests you, don't hesitate to hook your character into them! We'll figure out something fun.  </p>
<h2 id="abider-plate-band">Abider, Plate Band<a class="headerlink" href="#abider-plate-band" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Centuries of close proximity to the Dwarves and rich hills of the Tullado Cliffs have made venerates of The Guard into notable artisans, warriors, and smiths. These folk are known for the unmatched quality of their goods and works, such that Plate Band equipment is the envy of most folk outside the ranks of the Knights of the Blessed Throne.  </p>
<p>The Plate train all young members with hereditary weapon arts and heroic tales from a young age, eventually dispatching their adolescents far and wide to locate and protect a worthy person, or to become a person of such prominence that protection is earned by them. As an unfortunate consequence of the known quality of Plate Band goods, these young pilgrims have in more recent generations become frequent targets of bandits and unscrupulous swindlers.  </p>
<h2 id="abider-shadescale-band">Abider, Shadescale Band<a class="headerlink" href="#abider-shadescale-band" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Outsiders often misunderstand the Shadescale Band's veneration of all things Draconic as a practice involving worship of a particular dragon and its brood. The first young dragon who saw this clan of dragon worshipers and attempted to claim their love and adoration was similarly mistaken, at great personal cost. Rather than any embodied dragon, the Shadescale align themselves with the Dragon Frame. They see individual dragons as beautiful creatures bearing some shards of a greater divinity, unfortunately doomed by ego to dream small dreams of wealth and power.  </p>
<p>The Shadescale craft potent items and decorations from the leavings of all dragons they encounter, with little allegiance at play. A member of this band attains adulthood by creating a personal work from pieces of a dragon found or fought in their home region of the Chagny Molten, and delivering that work into the hoard of another dragon.  </p>
<h2 id="charmann-the-blasted-spellwaste">Charmânn, the Blasted Spellwaste<a class="headerlink" href="#charmann-the-blasted-spellwaste" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Once, the region of Charmânn was known for its beautiful waters, pleasing climate, and affable people. In the wake of the Blightseeker Pyroclasm in the year 348 OW, none of these things are true. For reasons lost to time if they ever existed at all, the Blightseeker Moldev worked impossible and great magic to shift the land itself. Moldev rearranged docile hills into a steep and craggy active volcano, whose eruption devastated and scarred the southwest portions of the Expanse.  </p>
<p>Having long been wary of their ambitious northern neighbors, the Inventors of Charmânn enacted a kind of Partition of their own, sealing away the magic in their lands to protect themselves forever from the Empire and its Mages. Almost 400 years since their lands were ruined in fire and ash, the Charmânn Admirality hold a tight grip on the arable lands of their domain and an even tighter grip on their strange weapons of blackpowder and metal.  </p>
<h2 id="the-empire-of-ash">The Empire of Ash<a class="headerlink" href="#the-empire-of-ash" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Unlike other countries and regions who regard the grand fallen Empire with skepticism and mistrust, the living denizens of Scythrân have only ever known their northern neighbor as a loose arrangement of cobbled together worldlings, practicing queer magicks of "governance" and "Democracy."  </p>
<h2 id="the-lyusan-heavensteppe">The Lyusan Heavensteppe<a class="headerlink" href="#the-lyusan-heavensteppe" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Much work and art has been made across the Heavensteppe of the mythical Land Without, a place bereft of the wicked wishes of wizards and witches. When news of the Partition's fall reached the Seven Plateaus, poets wept for the corruption.  </p>
<h2 id="other-foreigners">Other Foreigners<a class="headerlink" href="#other-foreigners" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Sailors from across the seas welcome the chance to trade and chart a land once thought to be lost to time. The Witches of the Writhing Isles and envoys from the Goetia have had particular success in evading informal blockades established by the Charmânn Admirality to do their business in the ports of Caenbonne and Duncér.  </p>
<h2 id="rubymist-luce">Rubymist Luce<a class="headerlink" href="#rubymist-luce" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Rubymist Luce are a small, insular clan dedicated to worship of the Apple above all other Frames. Their names vanished quickly from the histories and records of the people of Scythrân following their severing from the world, but their fellows know them as great tricksters: who else could sell amputation and receive only gratitude in return?  </p>
<p>As these lightbearers now mount their return to the Partition, what shall they find in the wake of their work? Who shall survive their next great jape?  </p>
<h2 id="skjev">Skjev<a class="headerlink" href="#skjev" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Given the sheer distance between their World-Tree and the Partition, few expected the Skjev to take much interest in Scythrâ politics or the affairs of her people. Time and again, however, Skjev travelers and even entire Choric corps have paid kind homage to the Queen Vair-Bore.  </p>
<h2 id="wanderers">Wanderers<a class="headerlink" href="#wanderers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Following their expulsion from the Citadel in the year 10 PS, the Wanderers have resumed their rhizomatic, mobile ways. Dotted along the Expanse doing their works and charting less bustling skies, some Wanderers have attempted the difficult journey to enter Scythrân. These people are highly experienced and powerful astrologers, met with a combination of excitment and awe.  </p>
