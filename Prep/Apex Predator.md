1x L10 Elite Megaloscute

Its hunting grounds won't be disturbed. The Megaloscute has a lopsided fin tail and four soft-tissue barbels hanging from its jaw. It attacks by darting into the fray, biting someone, and darting away. 

SPECIAL: If fought on the way to MÃ©lusine, the Megaloscute gains the SPITE reaction. 

LOOT: Nothing but the cold assurance of a great beast laid low.
