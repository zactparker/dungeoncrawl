Wishing Lake / Lac Souhaitant is a Dimitic Lake - its waters turn over from the highest layer, the epilimnion, through the middle layer, the thermocline, to the bottom layer, the hypolimnion, twice a year. The advent of a cool Fall has caused a burbling undeath to rise to the surface!

"You're no limnologist, but..."

If the herbivores are killed: Algal Bloom, a phenomena where a non-edible portion of the ecosystem engages in hypergrowth. Excess growth kills the trickle down of nutrients to the lowest layers and blights the soil. 

If the Carnivores are killed: 

If the invasive species is introduced: 

"Some of the most common fish found in lakes are tiny shiners,  sunfish,  perch,  bass,  crappie,  muskie, walleye,  perch,  lake trout,  pike,  eels,  catfish,  salmon, and sturgeon. Many of these provide food for people."

If they get anywhere dryer, they see: mosses, ferns, cattails, reeds, and rushes. Snails, shrimp, crayfish, worms, frogs, and dragonflies live among them. 

Waterbugs, beetles, and spiders crawl across the surface of lakes. Water lillies and hyacinths rest upon the surface due to air-filled bladders.
