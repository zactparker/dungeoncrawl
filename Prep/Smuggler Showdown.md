### Extreme 9

When backed into a corner, Hugo attacks to cover his tracks! 

Alternately, if he sees Ilksah in their plant form, he immediately drops what he's doing to attack.

1x L11 Kizidhar Shuyookh (Hugo Barbeau)
3x L8 Ambrost Mugland

The Queenbright Bandits have an arrangement of convenience with Hugo, and they won't die for him. If his suit is reduced to 0 hit points, Hugo (L9 Nilak) wild shapes into a Megaloscute to beg MÃ©lusine's protection.

1x THE FOOL
