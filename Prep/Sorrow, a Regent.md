### Extreme 9

Mélusine almost has what she needs--enough cooperation and footsoldiers from that buffoonish botanist to claim the Mantle Yielding for herself and reach its deepest depths to seize the Seed of Faith.

NOTE: Mélusine won't bargain with anyone who killed the Megaloscute. She thought it was cute, in an ugly way. 

NOTE: Mélusine will ally with those who defeat the Corsair (Thoughtseer) Astrid Duval or the slippery forces of Slick Corse to delve the Mantle.
