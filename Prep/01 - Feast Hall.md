Mélusine, the Corse, Corsair Astrid, Desirée, and The Gardener meet for a détente. Astrid selected the location. The Corse selected the topic. Mélusine selected the punishment. The Gardener selected the meal.

The arrival of the party causes each leader to accuse the others of treachery and flee. The Punishment, two pods of Seetangeist stirred by the Mantle Yielding's unusual occupation, turn on the party!

The Gardener: *TREACHERY* then Plane Shifts away.
The Corse (Murph Russian): *You FOOLS!*  then rushes out of the light, scrambles atop the lights leading west, and flees. Two other tentacled creatures follow suit, detaching from the shadows. 
Mélusine: Looks at the four heroes and walks away.
Desirée: *Oh no, Sister!*
Astrid: *Worry not, Sister. Take my hand. Let us depart.*
