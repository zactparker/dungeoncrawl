Elves and Gnomes of the Chausseurs are scarce in Urles, owing to the city's founding as a free state for short-lived folk and its distance from the Five Holds. It is unlikely that your character is both a long-lived folk and a onetime worshipper of the Firstfallen.

As normal for how traits work, any part of the effect that's unrelated to fire still works. For example, an attack with a flaming battleaxe could still deal its physical damage, just not its fire damage. - At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.  </p> <p>You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier.

Each Ancestry has something to them that feels really unique and fun but also not desperately offensive. I actually enjoyed reading the entries of even the bog-standard fantasy races. Gnomes are cool now! Check out the Nethys entry and rules for your Ancestry before you commit to one. That's a big ask since there's a million of them, so if you're pressed for time just look for the part in every entry that begins with \"If you want to play a character that...\" to get a sense of that Ancestry.</p> <p>Characters of all ancestries are present in the Partition. The dominant peoples of this region are Dwarves, Halflings, Humans, and Orcs. Animal-kin folk are less common, but Grippli, Kobolds, Lizardfolk, and Vanara all occupy positions of higher status across the Partition, owing to their ancient ancestors' continued presence and influence on the region. In this part of the world, people with Animal-kin Ancestries are presumed to be related through distant blood ties to one of the Ancient Beasts.</p> <p>Almost immediately after the Partition was established, the various magical creatures now trapped in a land sealed from magic made their displeasure known. From about 1060 OW ~ 748 OW was a time known as the Age of Beasts, where magical creatures established fiefdoms and claimed dominion over the land. Proving nigh-impossible to kill on account of being magical creatures with all their magic sealed inside of them, these creatures swept through embattled, isolated peoples with little resistance and ruled for uninterrupted centuries.</p> <p>Seeking to hide their less-than-mythic origins, the most sinister of the Beastlords thus attempted to systematically suppress and murder particularly wide-ranging and long-lived folk. Most Elves and Gnomes alive today have some level of family history reckoning with this violence, be that having cultivated ancestral techniques to fight monsters, having hidden themselves away, or having bought survival through entering into a protection arrangement with a Beastlord.

The only court in the land to use all of these titles at all times is the Court of the Blessed Monarch, typically housed in the capital city of Titan. Lesser courts of the 19 Seneschalties may use any configuration of these roles as required to suit their needs. Noble titles change hands through Divinity, Death, or Duels.</p> <p>Enshrined with the crowning of the first Blessed Monarch Th\u00e9omann Emerick I, the title of Blessed Monarch is held by the person Divinely Ordained by magic itself to steward the Partition. Custom dictates that, upon assuming the throne, the Ordained forgoes their given name and chooses a holy name, typically the name of Th\u00e9omann Emerick or a member of his Great House. The only Blessed Monarchs to forgo this tradition are Lo\u00efc I, who reigned immediately following Th\u00e9omann I for one unpleasant week, and the reigning queen Osanna Vair-Bore.</p> <p>All other positions are typically passed to a hand-picked successeur upon Death or debility of the current holder of office. Since the failed rebellion of the Duc Odouart des Paulmes, children of the Blessed Monarch are typically prepared from birth to set their ambitions as high as assuming a role through succession in order to ensure their family an enduring place at court.</p> <p>Succession by Duel was popularized by the Great and Honorable Milus\u00e8ne Emerick I. The tradition was ensconced firmly in the ways of the land by his daughter Milus\u00e8ne II, and her niece Milus\u00e8ne III after her, during an astonishing 70-year span where a single bloodline held the Blessed Throne. In its original conception, any person who could reach the bearer of an office was entitled to challenge that official to a duel to the death or the wound, with the petitioner selecting the location and the official selecting the weapon. Though still practiced to this day and orchestrated with fervor by the Honorable House of Puis (descendants of the Monarch Milus\u00e8ne I), many of the less martially inclined at court breathed a hearty sigh of relief when Th\u00e9omann II reformed the practice to make victory at an annual contest held at the Winter Palace a prerequisite for issuing a challenge.</p> <p>Blessed Monarch The person or (in one case!) persons Ordained by magic to lead the peoples inside the Partition.
