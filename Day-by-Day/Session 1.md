Hi hello quick check-ins:
-I'm planning a dungeon crawl! There will be encounter maps, but there won't be a single big map you're noodling across so it's not a strict "crawl" situation.
-I'll be keeping track of your progress, but you'll help yourselves out a ton by making a diagram/map to show your progress and what choices you have/haven't made
-I'm going to be playing around with cutting out some pieces that can get repetitive, so expect a healthy dose of "the monster falls with its last gasp. You loot XYZ!" rather than making you search the bodies, for example.
