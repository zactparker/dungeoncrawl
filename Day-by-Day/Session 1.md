Hi hello quick check-ins/Session 0:
-I'm planning a dungeon crawl! There will be encounter maps, but there won't be a single big map you're noodling across so it's not a strict "crawl" situation.
-I'll be keeping track of your progress, but you'll help yourselves out a ton by making a diagram/map to show your progress and what choices you have/haven't made
-I'm going to be playing around with cutting out some pieces that can get repetitive, so expect a healthy dose of "the monster falls with its last gasp. You loot XYZ!" rather than making you search the bodies, for example.

## Intro

Quiet reigns. Your journey to the lakebed was peaceful, following the trails of so many wishes. Silt gave way to stone as you neared your quarry: A flooded structure, half-buried in the lakebed. Wisps of cyan light illuminate the structure from the inside, yet inspection revealed no points of ingress outside of a single, yawning pore in the stone base.
